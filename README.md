**BoBe Agent** is an autonomous trading agent built for the **[CoinMarketCap API Hackathon](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/hackathon/)** (BNB HACK · CoinMarketCap × Trust Wallet × BNB Chain). It trades **4 BSC pairs, LONG only**, with a **no-stop DCA** strategy — averaging down without a stop-loss plus a dynamic, volatility-scaled take-profit. A separate daily *reflection-job* reviews the trade journal and recommends parameter tweaks (it never trades or changes the live config itself).

Every decision is made by an LLM: a Claude Code agent runs each tick, reads live market data and prices, and calls MCP tools to open / average / close positions. Live prices come from a real twak quote (bid/ask), and every trade executes as a **real on-chain swap** via twak.

## Architecture

```
cron (5,25,45 * * * *) → bash/start-all.sh → fan-out of bash/start-pair.sh across all pairs (CONCURRENCY, default 10)
bash/start-pair.sh (PAIR) → claude -p (tick-agent, monolithic):
  1. mcp__bobe__get_time      — server UTC (finish timing, bar-close check)
  2. mcp__bobe__get_market    — indicators for the closed H1 bar: hv (ATR%), dv (daily vol),
                               mv, ADX, CRSI/crsi_prev (H1, by the unclosed bar); + base/quote/token_address. Anti-repaint.
  3. mcp__cmc__*             — Fear & Greed, BTC dominance, (opt.) derivatives — regime tilt
  4. mcp__bobe__get_params    — active configuration (JSONB config)
  5. mcp__bobe__get_state     — active positions (LONG) with nested orders, last_trade_at, lessons, stats
  6. mcp__twak__get_swap_quote — live quote by token address, both legs → bid/ask
  7. decision per side: OPEN / ADD / CLOSE / HOLD
  8. mcp__bobe__open/add/close_position
  9. mcp__bobe__log_tick      — tick journal (always, + live_bid/live_ask)
  → record-usage.js → notify.js (Telegram)

cron (00:30) → bash/reflect-pair.sh (PAIR) → claude -p (reflection-job, does not trade)
```

## Strategy — no-stop DCA (in detail)

**We trade:** 4 BSC pairs (BTCB, ETH, WBNB, CAKE), **LONG only** (`config.side_mode=long`).
$100 per pair as a ladder of **$20 (entry) + $30 (1st avg.) + $50 (2nd avg.)**. Max one LONG per pair.
The schema and code remain side-aware (SHORT — a provision for the future/CEX), but the agent does not open shorts.

**Indicators (by closed H1 bars, anti-repaint):** `hv` — hourly vol (ATR-14%), `dv` — daily vol
(ATR-14% on the daily resample), `mv ≈ dv·√30`, `ADX(14)`, Connors RSI (**CRSI** = (RSI(3)+RSI(streak,2)+PercentRank(ROC1,100))/3 on the H1 scale; the current value — by the close of the unclosed H1 bar, `crsi_prev` — from the previous 20-min tick for detecting a line crossing).
The live price comes from the twak quote (ask = buy, bid = sell).

**1. Entry** (open the first leg $20) if ALL of the following hold:
- `ADX ≥ adx_lo` (default 16) — there is a trend;
- **momentum up:** the price moved up from the hourly close by `1·hv` (ADX 16–30) or `1.3·hv` (ADX≥30);
- **CRSI confirmation (crossing the line upward):** `crsi_prev < crsi_buy ≤ crsi`. Per-pair thresholds (`crsi_buy`/`crsi_sell`): BTCB 21.8/76, ETH 13/87.5, WBNB 17.3/79.8, CAKE 19.5/78. Removes entries "into the knife".

**2. Averaging (down, no stop):**
- **avg1 ($30):** drawdown from entry ≥ `⅔·dv` (ADX 16–30) or `1·dv` (ADX≥30);
- **avg2 ($50):** deeper — `3·dv` — AND only on a CRSI line crossing (§3 of the prompt).

**3. Exit — take-profit only:** close the ENTIRE position when `bid` reaches
`opened_price·(1 + tp_mult·hv)` (`tp_mult` = 1.3 → +130% of the hourly vol from the average). **There is no stop** — we do not exit at a loss
voluntarily, we wait for a rebound (spot). A hard guard: `close_position` rejects closing at a clean loss
(except a forced finish with `force=true`).

**4. Hackathon finish:** when `config.hackathon_end` is set — in the last ~24h we do not open new positions;
~2h before, we forcibly close everything (`force=true`).

### Costs

The trade cost (the spread) is **already baked into the real ask/bid** — it is not subtracted from PnL separately (otherwise double counting).
**The spread does NOT filter the entry** (no-stop): we enter on a signal and wait for the price to move to profit. The take-profit by construction
covers the spread — for `bid` to exceed the average (at ask) by `tp_mult·hv`, the price needs to travel the spread + take-profit. The server-side
`close_position` guard (net>0) does not allow locking in a loss.

> On BSC the real round-trip is wide (~1.4%) → the take-profit is reachable only when the pair moves by spread + take-profit (~2%);
> positions open and wait. This is the honest reality of the venue (see the cost ceiling in the project notes).

### Per-pair parameters (`params.config`, JSONB)

`side_mode` (long), `sizes_usd` [20,30,50], `tp_mult` (1.3), `adx_lo` (16)/`adx_hi` (30), `crsi_buy`/`crsi_sell` (per-pair crossing thresholds), `crsi_rsi_period`/`crsi_streak_period`/`crsi_rank_period` (3/2/100), `crsi_prev_max_age_min` (60), `avg1_depth_mult_lo/hi`, `avg2_depth_mult` (3), `max_adds` (2),
`hackathon_end` (opt.). The multipliers auto-scale the thresholds to each pair's volatility —
one set works for all; per-pair divergence is resolved by fact through reflection.

## Experience analysis (reflection-job, "recommendations only" mode)

Once a day it reads the journal (`positions`+nested `orders` / `tick_log`) and **only recommends** to the human what is worth
changing in `config` (net PnL, time to take-profit, averagings, open drawdowns → advice on `tp_mult`/`adx`/`crsi_buy`/`crsi_sell`/depths).
**It changes NOTHING active itself:** proposals are created as INACTIVE params versions
(`propose_params auto_apply=false`), activated by a human. It does not activate/roll back versions, does not write
lessons/statistics. Its own analysis (what it looked at, conclusions, recommendations) it writes to `reflection_log` via
`log_reflection` — from there a summary goes to the human in Telegram. The strategy type (no-stop DCA) does not change.

## MCP tools (the `bobe` server)

- **Tick:** `get_time`, `get_market`, `get_params`, `get_state` (active positions with nested `orders`), `log_tick`, `open_position`, `add_to_position`, `close_position` (with `force`), `fill_order` (confirm the swap fill: `comp_*`/`tx_id`), `cancel_order` (swap did not go through). Lifecycle: open/add/close create an `active` order → swap → `fill_order`/`cancel_order`.
- **Reflection (the server has all of them, but the job in "recommendations only" mode uses a subset):** reading — `get_time`, `get_trades`, `get_ticks`, `get_missed_moves`, `get_params_history`; writing — `propose_params` (inactive candidates, `auto_apply=false`), `record_params_perf` and `log_reflection` (an analysis summary into the `reflection_log` table → Telegram). The tools that change the active policy (`activate_params`, `rollback_params`, `upsert_lesson`, `deactivate_lesson`, `upsert_regime_stats`) are NOT included in the reflection allow-list.

Privilege separation is via `--allowedTools`: the tick-agent sees only the tick tools, reflection — only reading + recommendations.

## Installation (from scratch)

**Requirements:** PostgreSQL **≥ 12**; **Node.js ≥ 22** (the twak CLI requires node≥22 — under 18 it crashes); in PATH — `node`, `claude` (CLI), `twak`, `psql`. The `bash/*` scripts pick up nvm (default ≥22) themselves.

1. `createdb bobe_agent` — create the DB.
2. `cp .env.example .env` and fill it in:
   - `AGENT_MODEL` / `REFLECTION_MODEL` — the Claude models for the tick-agent and reflection-job.
   - `DB_*` — PostgreSQL connection (and `DB_TEST_*` if you will run the DB tests).
   - `WALLET_ADDRESS` / `BSC_RPC_URL` / `TATUM_API_KEY` — the trading wallet and the BSC RPC used to read swap receipts in `fill_order` (`core/blockchain.js`). `TATUM_API_KEY` only if the RPC is a Tatum gateway.
   - `CMC_API_KEY` — CoinMarketCap MCP (market regime).
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` — trade/closure/error notifications.
   - The twak wallet itself is configured in the `twak` MCP (see `.mcp.json`). Trades are real on-chain swaps, so fund the wallet only when you are ready to trade.
3. `npm ci` — project dependencies (a single `node_modules` at the root).
4. `./db/migrate.sh bobe_agent` — apply the migrations (9 tables; idempotent, `--status` — what is applied).
5. `bash/install.sh` — seed the parameters (4 pairs: BTCB/ETH/WBNB/CAKE, long-only) and warm up the candles.
6. `bash/install-cron.sh` — install cron (tick 5,25,45 + reflection 00:30 + candles once a minute; `--remove` to remove).

The pools and addresses of the 4 pairs — in `core/config.json`.

## Running (manually)

The scripts are symmetric: `*-pair.sh` — a worker for one pair, `*-all.sh` — a fan-out across all pairs.

```bash
PAIR=WBNB/USDT bash/start-pair.sh --dev # one tick of one pair with live output
PAIR=WBNB/USDT bash/start-pair.sh       # quietly (as in cron)
bash/start-all.sh                        # fan-out of ticks across all pairs (CONCURRENCY=10; CONCURRENCY=4 — gentler on rate-limit)
PAIR=WBNB/USDT bash/reflect-pair.sh --dev # reflection of one pair with output
bash/reflect-all.sh                      # fan-out of reflection across all pairs (once a day)
bash/candles-all.sh                      # refresh the 1h candles for all pairs in the DB (for the dashboard)
bash/install-cron.sh                     # tick 5,25,45 + reflection 00:30 + candles once a minute; --remove to remove
```

The scripts are **self-sufficient regarding `PATH`** (they add `~/.local/bin` etc. themselves) — in cron
a `PATH=...` prefix is not needed, the full path is enough: `1 * * * * /path/to/bash/start-all.sh`.

## Web dashboard (UI)

The **BNB Hack** dashboard — read-only observation of the agent (no authentication, dark theme): pair selection +
the latest price, a candlestick chart (TradingView lightweight-charts) with the average entry price line of open
positions, tables of positions and ticks (filter by the agent's decision type), strategy parameters, self-learning
conclusions (`reflection_log`) and PnL by pair/portfolio.

It consists of two parts in this same monorepo (a single root `package.json`/`node_modules`):
- `api/` — a REST API on Fastify + TypeScript (port `3001`), reads the DB and GeckoTerminal.
- `front/` — an SPA on React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + HeroUI (port `5173`), calls the API.

Candles: **both the dashboard API and the agent itself** (`mcp get_market`) read them **from the DB** (the `candles` table),
and it is filled by the cron script `candles-all.sh` (1h for all pairs, once a minute; `install-cron.sh` installs the
entry) — this is the **only** one that calls GeckoTerminal. 4h/1d are resampled from 1h on read.
Therefore the candles cron must be running (on the first run, fill the DB manually, otherwise the tick-agent will get
empty data and do a HOLD). One-off fill:
```bash
bash/candles-all.sh                  # or npm run candles:refresh — fill the DB with candles
```

### Running (dev, auto-restart on code change)
```bash
npm ci                               # project dependencies (including the UI)
npm run dev                          # API (:3001) + front (:5173) at once, both with auto-reload
```
Or separately in two terminals:
```bash
npm run api:dev                      # API on :3001, tsx watch — restart on API/core code edits
npm run front:dev                    # front on :5173 (Vite HMR), proxy /api → :3001
```
Open in the browser: **http://localhost:5173**. `api:start` — the same without watch (for a prod-like run).
The API port — `API_PORT`; the CORS allowlist for prod — `CORS_ORIGINS=https://example.com,...`.
API logs are written to stdout and to `logs/api.log` (`LOG_LEVEL`, `API_LOG_FILE`); 5xx to the outside — as a generic
message, the real text only in the log (enable to the outside: `API_DEBUG=true`).

### Build (prod)
```bash
npm run front:build                  # static into front/dist/
npm run front:preview                # local preview of the built static
```
For production: serve `front/dist/` with any static server/CDN, proxying `/api/*` to the running
`npm run api:start` (or a `node` process with the same code).

## Tests
```bash
npm test                             # node --test: core/mcp/bin + the shared layer tests/ (factories, foundation)
npm run test:api                     # vitest: API routes (via fastify.inject + a test DB)
npm run test:front                   # vitest + RTL + MSW: front components/widgets
npm run test:e2e                     # Playwright: responsiveness desktop/tablet/mobile (brings up api+front itself)
npm run test:all                     # node (core/mcp/bin) + api + front in a single run
npm run test:db:reset                # apply the migrations to the test DB (DB_TEST_DATABASE)
```
Test data is built by factories from `tests/` (the deterministic candle generator
`makeCandles`, the seeders `seedParams/seedPosition/seedOrder/...`) — a single source of defaults.
Each test with the DB runs in a transaction with an unconditional ROLLBACK (isolation, no leftover garbage).

> **Test DB** (needed for `api` and all DB tests): `createdb bobe_agent_test && npm run test:db:reset`.
> The connection parameters — `DB_TEST_*` in `.env` (see `.env.example`). The safeguard in `tests/db.js`
> fails if the DB name does not contain `test`, so that the autotests physically cannot touch the prod DB.

### Test architecture (how to write new ones — we keep a single style)

- **Location.** A test sits next to the code: `foo.js` → `foo.test.js` (api/front — in their own `tests/`/`__tests__`). Shared helpers and factories — in the root `tests/`, NOT in `core/` (that is prod code).
- **Two runners, deliberately.** `core/mcp/bin` are run by `node --test` (prod code is executed as raw JS without a build — we test it with that, instantly). `api` (TS) and `front` (jsdom) — `vitest`. Write a new test for core/mcp/bin under `node:test` + `node:assert/strict`.
- **The DB is real, not a mock.** The money arithmetic lives in SQL — mocking pg is pointless (you would lose exactly what you are checking). Take `setupTestDb()` + wrap the body in `withTx(async () => { ... })` from `tests/db.js`: each test in a transaction with an unconditional ROLLBACK, no leftover garbage.
- **Data — by factories.** Do not insert rows by hand: `seedParams/seedPosition/seedOrder/seedTick/seedCandles/seedReflection/seedLesson` from `tests/factories.js` (a single source of defaults). Candles — `makeCandles({ pattern })` from `tests/candles.js` (deterministic, without `Math.random`).
- **External APIs — mock `globalThis.fetch`.** We do not call GeckoTerminal and the rest of the network: we substitute `globalThis.fetch` in the test and restore it in `finally`.
- **Extract pure logic so it can be tested.** If a file performs a side effect on import (a connection to stdio, `process.exit`, reading stdin) — wrap the auto-launch in the guard `process.argv[1] === fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)`, and export the logic (examples: `mcp/validation.js`, `bin/refresh-candles.mjs`, `mcp/record-usage.js`).
- **Front — RTL + MSW.** Requests are mocked via `@/test/msw` (`server.use(http.get(...))`); an unmocked request fails the test (`onUnhandledRequest: 'error'`). Selectors — by role/`data-testid`, not by text.

## Deployment to a server

The deploy script — after `git pull`:
```bash
cd <project-path>
git pull origin release            # prod branch
npm ci                             # dependencies (a single node_modules at the root)
bash db/migrate.sh                 # new migrations (idempotent — only the fresh ones are applied)
npm run front:build                # rebuild the dashboard static → front/dist
```
On the first rollout, additionally: `createdb bobe_agent`, `./db/migrate.sh bobe_agent`, `bash/install.sh`,
`bash/install-cron.sh` (tick + reflection + candles), `npm run candles:refresh` (fill the candles once).

### Web dashboard on the server
- **API** — a long-lived process (systemd / pm2 etc.): `npm run api:start` (= `tsx api/src/index.ts`),
  reads `.env`, listens on the port `API_PORT` (default `3001`). Keep `3001` closed from the outside (firewall) —
  only nginx publishes it externally. If the front and API are on one domain (nginx below) — CORS is not needed;
  otherwise set `CORS_ORIGINS=https://dashboard.example.com`.
- **Candles** — the cron `bash/candles-all.sh` (installed by `bash/install-cron.sh`) fills the `candles` table once a minute.
- **Front** — the static `front/dist` (after `npm run front:build`), served by nginx; `/api/*` it proxies
  to the API. The front calls relative `/api/*`, therefore a separate domain/port for the front is not needed.

> The build (`front:build`, vite) and running the API (`api:start`, tsx) need devDependencies — install with the regular
> `npm ci`, NOT `npm ci --omit=dev`.

An nginx example (front + API on one domain):
```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name dashboard.example.com;
  # ssl_certificate ... ; ssl_certificate_key ... ;

  root /path/to/bobe-agent/front/dist;
  index index.html;

  # SPA: any unknown path → index.html (client-side rendering)
  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }

  # API → Node process. proxy_pass WITHOUT a path and trailing slash: nginx passes the full /api/...,
  # and the API routes already contain the /api prefix. If you add a slash (.../;) — the prefix is stripped and you get a 404.
  location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3001;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }

  # hashed Vite assets can be cached for a long time
  location /assets/ {
    root /path/to/bobe-agent/front/dist;
    expires 30d;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
  }
}
```

**Before going live:**
- Trades execute as real on-chain swaps — double-check `WALLET_ADDRESS` / the twak wallet, that it is funded, and that you really intend to trade real funds.
- Set the hackathon end time (UTC) — without it the finish (closing positions) will not trigger:
```sql
UPDATE params SET config = jsonb_set(config,'{hackathon_end}','"2026-06-22T23:59:00Z"'::jsonb,true) WHERE is_active;
```

## Operation

```bash
# decisions / positions / active params
psql -d bobe_agent -c "SELECT id,pair,action,regime,close,adx,left(reason,60) FROM tick_log ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"
psql -d bobe_agent -c "SELECT id,pair,side,status,opened_amount,opened_price,realized_pnl_pct,force_closed FROM positions ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"
psql -d bobe_agent -c "SELECT id,position_id,action,status,comp_size,comp_amount,comp_price,tx_id FROM orders ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"
psql -d bobe_agent -c "SELECT pair,config->>'tp_mult' tp,config->>'hackathon_end' fin,config->>'side_mode' side FROM params WHERE is_active ORDER BY pair;"
```

- Logs: `logs/start-pair-<PAIR>-*.log`, `logs/reflect-pair-<PAIR>-*.log`.
- **GeckoTerminal 429:** `CONCURRENCY` defaults to 10; `market.js` does backoff (12s, up to 4 attempts). If noisy — `CONCURRENCY=4 bash/start-all.sh`.

## Stack

Claude Code (tick-agent + reflection) · MCP server `bobe` on Node.js (`mcp/`, namespace `mcp__bobe__*`) ·
CMC MCP (market regime) · Trust Wallet `twak` MCP (live quotes + on-chain swaps) · GeckoTerminal (OHLCV) · PostgreSQL · Telegram · bash/cron.
**UI:** a shared core `core/` (db/market/indicators) · API `api/` on Fastify + TypeScript · front `front/` on React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + HeroUI (lightweight-charts, React Query).

## Security

- **Tool whitelisting (`--allowedTools`):** each Claude Code run only sees the MCP tools it needs. The tick-agent gets the quote + `swap` and the position lifecycle tools; the reflection-job gets read + recommendation tools only. Tools are gated at launch (`bash/start-pair.sh` / `bash/reflect-pair.sh`), not inside the server.
- **Privilege separation:** the tick trades but does not change the configuration; reflection does not trade and changes NOTHING active — it only recommends (inactive proposals for a human).
- **Invariants:** sizes strictly `sizes_usd`, ≤ `max_adds` averagings, ≤1 position/side/pair (unique-index),
  closing only in profit (except `force=true`); the `config` ranges reflection keeps itself (there is no CHECK on JSONB in the DB).
- **Pair isolation:** `add/close_position` verify `pair`; adding/closing — transactions with `SELECT FOR UPDATE`.

The agent executes **real on-chain swaps with real funds** on BNB Smart Chain — it is fully autonomous and an LLM makes every trading decision. Crypto trading carries substantial risk, including the **total loss** of the deployed capital; the no-stop DCA strategy holds losing positions without a stop-loss by design.
